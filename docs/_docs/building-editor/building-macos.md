## Installing Requirements

First of all. Make sure your graphics card supports OpenGL 4.1+.

- [MacOS OpenGL Version Support](https://support.apple.com/HT202823)

Now, install all these tools using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew update
brew install cmake conan llvm ninja
xcode-select --install
```

## Configuring Conan Profile

You must create a default conan profile:

```sh
conan profile new default --detect
```

## Cloning the Engine Respository

First, let's clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luizgabriel/Spatial.Engine.git
cd Spatial.Engine
```

## Building the Engine from the Command Line

Now, inside the project's folder. Run this script install all required conan dependencies which are not found by conan
by default.

```
python ./cli.py run-editor
```

> The first time you run takes a lot of time to download and build the external dependencies.
